0. What's new

- goal can be described as a CNF formula

1. Compilation

        make

    + Requirements:

        flex, bison and a C++ compiler such as g++.

2. Usage

    cpa input_domain [options]

a) input_domain: A domain described in the AL language. This 
   version does not support variables and static laws.

b) Options
    -e action1 action2 action3 ...
       Perform a sequence of actions and print out
       results step by step. The planner does not
       search for a plan.      

c) Examples

    cpa blw.al
       Find a conformant plan for blw.al

    cpa blw.al -e "move(2,table)" "move(1,2)"
       Execute the plan [move(2,table);move(1,2)]

3. Files
   - README:      this file
   - Makefile:    the make file
   - define.h:    contains compilation directives, constants, 
                  and some auxiliary classes.
   - main.cpp:	  main program
   - action.*:    implement actions (class Action)
   - state.*:     implement states and c-states (class State & CState)
   - planner.*:   the planner. The most notable functions are
         (i) next_cstate: computes the next belief state
         (ii)  explore_one: explores one more level of the search tree
         (iii)   search: does the search
   - reader.*:    the data structure for storing the input after
                  scanning and parsing
   - lcp.y & lcp.lex: The scanner & parser components.

4. Main Classes
   - Planner
   - Action
   - State
   - CState: is a set of states
   - Reader: stores the results after scanning & parsing the input
