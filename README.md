DNFct-FRDCSA

Somewhere there is a document showing that DNFct outperforms the other
planners (Pong, Contingent-ff, ?), but I can't seem to find it.
Anyways it the winning planner.  It also works with SWIPL, which works
well for us.  I am including also an Event Calculus planner that seems
promising.
